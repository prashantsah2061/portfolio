# My Portfolio Website

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work, skills, and experience in data science and web development. I built this from scratch to have a clean, professional way to present myself online.

## What's Inside

- **Responsive design** that looks great on any device
- **Dark/light mode toggle** because I like having options
- **Smooth animations** to make the site feel alive
- **Easy contact methods** - just click to email me or check out my profiles
- **Clean, modern design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive elements** that respond to user actions

## Tech Stack

I used these technologies to build this site:

- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **JavaScript** for all the interactive features
- **AOS library** for scroll animations
- **Font Awesome** for icons
- **Google Fonts** for typography
